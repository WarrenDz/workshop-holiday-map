        <p>Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure.
          This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that?
          Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
          It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is.
          Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky.</p>

        <p>Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.
          You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
          The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
          Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...
          I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him.
          He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

          I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen. We haven't that much with us.
          But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay.
          You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.</p>

        <p>We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
          All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.
          You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir. Luke? Luke? Luke?
          Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.

          Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men.
          
          I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
          You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away! Holding her is dangerous.</p>

        <p>Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run.
          This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters!
          There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait!
          Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range.

          We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart.

          Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
          The sensors are placed.

          No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful.
          You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment?
          Everyone's invited, of course.</p>

        <h2>Section 5</h2>
        <p>Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you.
          Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like. something out of a dream, or, I don't know.
          Maybe I'm just going crazy. Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord.
          But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk.

          Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny.
          Ben, why didn't you tell me? Alert all commands.
          
          There's something alive down there. Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead.
          I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle.
          
          No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.</p>

        <p>Who's worried? Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land.
          don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
          No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology.
          Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there. Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
